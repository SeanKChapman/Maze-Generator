# Maze-Generator

This is a randomized maze-generating program that I wrote in my Junior year of high school. It uses a 
recursive backtracker implementation of the Depth-first-search algorithm to generate a unique maze in Java

Here are a couple samples generated by this program!

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="/maze1.png"></img></td>
    <td><img src="/maze2.png"></img></td>
  </tr>
</table>
